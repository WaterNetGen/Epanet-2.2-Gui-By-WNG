# Epanet-2.2-Gui-By-WNG
Graphical User Interface for Epanet 2.2, by the WaterNetGen team.

EPANET is a public domain software developed by USEPA. The original code can be found at EPANET site (https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet) or at EPA's GitHub Site (https://github.com/USEPA/epanet-solver). The latest release (2.00.12.01) is dated from Oct. 2018.

The Open Source EPANET Initiative (https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET) recently release an updated DLL, which work with the legacy GUI (but without access to the new features).

The WaterNetGen team want to contribute to this initiative with an implementation of an improved Graphical User Interface that take advantage of the new features (e.g. Presure-Driven and Demand-Driven simulations & Additional Convergence Parameters) with improved visualization capabilities (Deficient nodes and Demand reduction).
